 ## Overview
  
This is the problem statement of government of Goa that came in [SIH](https://www.sih.gov.in/). I decided to build a mobile app for the college authorities where alumini can register and be in contact with the college authorities regarding their advancement since leaving college. The alumini would know about all the events ,have facility to talk with their juniors in college ,make groups and be in contact with their ex-classmates.
 
 
## Features

I have designed half the UI needed for the project using firebase while the functional part of app ,ie, connecting with backend remains.
I plan to use firebase for providing flexible backend.
